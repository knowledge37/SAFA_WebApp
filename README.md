//THE DOCUMENT INTERFACE
//-----------------------
//The Document interface represents any web page loaded in the browser and serves as an entry point into the web page's content, which is the DOM tree. 
//The DOM tree includes elements such as <body> and <table>, among many others. 
//It provides functionality globally to the document, like how to obtain the page's URL and create new elements in the document.
//
//In this application, we make use of:
//  document.querySelector();
//  document.AddEventListner();
//  document.CreateElement();
